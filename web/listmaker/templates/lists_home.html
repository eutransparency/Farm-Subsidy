    <h3>What are lists?</h3>

    <p>Lists allow you to put together groups of recipients. Lists work just like an online shopping cart or an Amazon.com wish list. Once you begin making a list you can keep on adding as many recipients as you like to that list. You can use a list as a simple way of adding payments made to multiple recipients or you can save and publish your list for other people to see. Saving a list also means you can come back to it later.</p>

    <p>You can make any kind of list you like. You could make a list of large multinational companies, politicians getting farm subsidies, or farms in your local area. We hope lists will be a way for people to make more sense of the data presented on the website. <a href="{% url all_lists %}">Here are the latest lists that have been made</a>.</p>
