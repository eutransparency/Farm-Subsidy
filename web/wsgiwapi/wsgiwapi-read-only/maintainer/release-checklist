Things to do when making a release:

 - ensure that ./runtests.py passes.
 - generate the documentation for the release.  (./make_docs.sh)
 - update setup.py to list the version number (two changes - the version
   number, and the planned tarball download location).
 - update docs/index.html to list the version number of the release (instead of
   "development version").  Commit the change.
 - "svn cp trunk tags/release-X.Y.Z".  Commit the tagged copy.
 - change website/index.html to list the documentation for the released
   version.  Commit.
 - update the website, and copy the current documentation to a release
   directory.
 - change docs/index.html to say "development version" instead of the release
   number.
 - run "./make_docs.sh" and "./setup.py sdist upload" in tagged copy.
 - upload the package to google code, too.
 - upload updated documentation to pypi.
