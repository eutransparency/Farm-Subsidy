README
======

WSGIWAPI is intended to make it extremely easy to make web APIs based on
Python programs.

See docs/introduction.html, or http://wsgiwapi.tartarus.org/, for an
introduction to WSGIWAPI.

You can run the testsuite by running "./runtests.py".

All changes are logged in the ChangeLog.

Prerequisites
=============

WSGIWAPI should work with python versions 2.5 and 2.6.  Support for
python 3.0 is not yet implemented, but it is not expected to be difficult.

To use JSON support (eg, the "jsonreturning" decorator), you will need the
"simplejson" module.
